Easily insert images and photos into your blog posts! WP Inject searches the huge Flickr database for creative commons photos related to any topic.

== Description ==

[WP Inject](http://wpinject.com/ "Free plugin to insert images into WordPress posts") allows you to **easily insert photos and images into your WordPress posts**. Search among many thousands of creative commons images for any keywords of your choice, then pick the best of them for the article you are working on and insert them into your post or set them as featured image! Best of all it is super fast: Injecting an image only takes 3 clicks in total!

No further setup is required after installing WP Inject. You can start inserting photos right away! To do so the plugin adds an easy to use search metabox to your WordPress editor ("Add New" post screens). Simply enter any keyword to find great photos for your post. 

Advanced users can head to the WP Inject settings page and fine tune the plugin. A lot of different options let you control most aspects of how WP Inject finds and inserts images into your posts. By editing the templates you can control exactly how the photos and automatic attribution will look on your blog!

**Have a look at my [tutorial on how to install and use WP Inject](http://wpinject.com/tutorial/ "How to insert images with WP Inject") to get started with the plugin.** Besides explaining the basics the tutorial also contains details on all the available settings in WP Inject and how the plugin works together with WordPress SEO by Yoast. 

= Features: =
*  Search thousands of creative commons photos and include any into your posts.
*  Fast and easy: Inserting images takes 3 clicks and less than a minute!
*  Automatically adds the required attribution links next to the image.
*  Set the featured image for your post with a single click.
*  Insert multiple images at once and create whole galleries! 
*  Choose between several image sizes easily.
*  Modify the templates of WP Inject to change how images get displayed in your posts.
*  Images are saved to your own server and added to the WordPress media library.
*  Automatically populated ALT and title tags of the image for search engine optimization.
*  Search for many different keywords and compare the results to find the best matches.
*  Can use and insert your focus keyword set in WordPress SEO by Yoast for easier image search optimization.


I will update WP Inject regularly. The first feature update was released only a week after the initial launch of WP Inject and more will certainly follow soon! 

I plan to add more image sources besides Flickr to the plugin in the future and eventually make it possible to inject much more than just images with WP Inject, e.g. videos, ads, products and news stories. Stay tuned! 

If you find any bugs please report them! General feedback or feature requests are also welcome.
